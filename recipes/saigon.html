    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Saigon Noodle Salad, also known as bun cha gio,
        is a vibrant and delicious Vietnamese dish that combines the
        freshness of vegetables, the flavor of grilled meat,
        and the texture of rice noodles. The salad typically
        features a bed of thin rice noodles, topped with a variety
        of colorful vegetables such as lettuce, bean sprouts, cucumber,
        and carrots. These vegetables provide a refreshing crunch
        and a burst of flavors. Additionally, fresh herbs like mint,
        cilantro, and Thai basil are often added, which contribute to
        the salad's aromatic and vibrant profile.

        One of the key components of Saigon Noodle Salad is the protein,
        usually grilled pork or shrimp. The meat is marinated with
        a combination of fish sauce, garlic, lemongrass, and other spices,
        giving it a fragrant and savory taste. The grilled meat is then thinly
        sliced and placed on top of the noodles and vegetables. To enhance
        the overall flavor, the salad is often drizzled with a sweet
        and tangy Vietnamese dressing made with fish sauce, lime juice, sugar,
        and chili. The combination of textures, flavors, and aromas
        makes Saigon Noodle Salad a refreshing and satisfying dish, perfect for
        warm weather or as a light meal option.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Whisk water, lime juice, fish sauce, brown sugar,
                garlic, ginger, and Sriracha together in a bowl
                until the sugar is dissolved.
            </p>
        </li>

            <p>
                Bring a large pot of water to a full boil;
                remove from heat and soak rice noodles in the hot
                water for 1 minute. Stir to separate the
                noodles and continue soaking until the noodles
                are tender, about 3 minutes more. Drain noodles and
                rinse with cold water until cooled. Shake
                noodles in colander to drain as much water as possible.

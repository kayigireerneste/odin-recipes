    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Summer Watermelon Gazpacho is a refreshing and vibrant cold soup
        that combines the sweetness of watermelon with the savory flavors
        of traditional gazpacho ingredients. This chilled soup is
        perfect for hot summer days, as it provides a cooling and hydrating
        experience. The base of the gazpacho is made with ripe watermelon,
        which is pureed until smooth, resulting in a silky and
        luscious texture. Watermelon's natural sweetness adds a delightful
        twist to the traditional gazpacho recipe.

        Along with the watermelon, Summer Watermelon Gazpacho incorporates
        other fresh ingredients such as tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers,
        and red onions. These ingredients add a variety of flavors
        and textures to the soup. Tomatoes contribute a tangy and slightly
        acidic taste, while cucumbers provide a crisp and refreshing
        crunch. Bell peppers and red onions add a subtle spiciness and a hint
        of bite. The soup is typically seasoned with a combination of
        olive oil, vinegar (often sherry vinegar), garlic, salt, and pepper,
        which enhance the overall taste and bring all the flavors together.
        The result is a chilled soup bursting with the sweetness of watermelon
        and the vibrant flavors of summer vegetables, creating a harmonious
        and refreshing culinary experience.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Combine watermelon, tomatoes, red pepper,
                cucumber, shallot, lime juice, vinegar, salt,
                and pepper in a high-powered blender.
                Blend until smooth, 20 to 30 seconds.
                Refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow flavors
                to meld and soup to chill.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Stir gazpacho before serving, as it has a tendency to separate,
                and divide between 4 bowls. Top with feta cheese and cilantro.

                To seed tomatoes, cut in half horizontally and
                gently squeeze to release seeds and excess liquid.
